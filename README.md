# Nodes-in-Linked-List
A linked list is a data structure in computer programming that consists of a collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The nodes are connected in a linear manner, forming a chain-like structure.

The key points about nodes in a linked list are:

Definition: A node is a basic unit of a linked list, and it contains two main components: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

Data: Each node in a linked list can store a specific data value or an object, depending on the implementation. This data represents the information that the linked list is designed to store, such as integers, characters, or complex objects.

Next reference: Each node in a linked list also contains a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence. This reference is used to establish the link or connection between adjacent nodes in the linked list, forming the linear structure.

Structure: Nodes in a linked list are typically dynamically allocated in memory and can be arranged in a variety of ways, such as singly linked list (where each node has a reference to only the next node), doubly linked list (where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes), or circular linked list (where the last node has a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure).

Operations: Nodes in a linked list can be manipulated using common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. These operations involve updating the references between nodes to maintain the integrity of the linked list.
